This is our Final Project for The course (Big) Data Curation  

## Disease Prediction 

This Github repository is meant to be able to reproduce the findings from our Disease Prediction Scientific Report 

main.py : Initiates the whole model to get the full overview of the classification reports, visualizations, statistical results. 

ml_models.py : contains all the training and testing of each ML model

visuals.py: contains all the functions to create the plots and heatmap

pre_process.py: contains all the preprocessing steps needed in order to visualize the data. 

data folder : Contains the dataset in dataset.csv

*** Take note that param_grids are commented out as it takes long to run these, but the current DT and GB model has the optimal hyperparameters based on the Grid Search. ***
